#Variables are used to refer memory locations, and are also called as identifiers.
#python has no command for declaring a variable, a variable is created as soon as we assign a value to it.

#Example:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

#we can also get the data type of a variable using casting.

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
