# tuples are like list, only difference being that these are immutable.

#example:
t1=(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
t2=(69, 169, 269, 369, 469, 569, 669, 769, 869)
print(t1)
print(t2)

#Operations on tuples:
# 1: Adding Tuples:
t3 = t1 + t2
print(t3)

# 2: Repeating Tuples:
print(t1 * 2)
print(t2 * 3)
